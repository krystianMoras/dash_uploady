[React Uploady](https://github.com/rpldy/react-uploady) adapted do Dash
Inspiration and some code from [Dash Uploader](https://github.com/fohrloop/dash-uploader)
supports:
- custom onClick target (DashUploadyTarget) component to show file browser
- webkitdirectory and multiple
- progress and errors

You decide how you want to visualize your errors

This is a very minimal adaptation, because that is all I needed. I may or may not update this in future - depends on my projects.
